# ABSTRACT: auditd log parser with no external dependencies, using no perl features past 5.12

=head1 WHY

I had to do reporting for non-incremental backups.
I needed something faster than GNU find, and which took less memory as well.
I didn't want to stat 1M+ files.
Just reads a log and keeps the bare minimum useful information.

You can use auditd for a number of other interesting purposes, which this should support as well.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $parser = Audit::Log->new();
    my $rows = $parser->search(
        type     => qr/path/i,
        nametype => qr/delete|create|normal/i,
        name     => qr/somefile.txt/i,
    );

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 new(STRING path, ARRAY returning) = Audit::Log

Opens the provided audit log path when searching, or

    /var/log/audit/audit.log

if none is provided.

Also can filter returned keys by the provided array to not allocate unnecesarily in low mem situations.

=head3 using with ausearch

It's common to have the audit log be quite verbose, and log-rotated.
To get around that you can dump pieces of the audit log as appropriate with ausearch.
Here's an example of dumping keyed events for the last day, which you could then load into new().

    ausearch --raw --key backupwatch -ts `date --date yesterday '+%x'` > yesterdays-audit.log

Even then the audit log is quite likely to only have a few days of retention.
Be sure to stash results appropriately.

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class, $path, @returning) = @_;
    $path = '/var/log/audit/audit.log' unless $path;
    die "Cannot access $path" unless -f $path;
    return bless({ path => $path, returning => \@returning}, $class);
}

=head1 METHODS

=head2 search(key => constraint) = ARRAY[HashRef{}]

Searches the log for lines where the value corresponding to the provided key matches the constraint, which is expected to be a quoted regex.
If no constraints are provided, all matching rows will be returned.

Example:

    my $rows = $parser->search( type => qr/path/i, nametype=qr/delete|create|normal/i );

The above effectively will get you a list of all file modifications/creations/deletions in watched directories.

Adds in a 'line' parameter to rows returned in case you want to know which line in the log it's on.
Also adds a 'timestamp' parameter, since this is a parsed parameter.

=head3 Speeding it up: by event

Auditd logs are also structured in blocks separated between SYSCALL lines, which are normally filtered by 'key', which corresponds to rule name.
We can speed up processing by ignoring events of the incorrect key.

Example:

    my $rows = $parser->search( type => qr/path/i, nametype=qr/delete|create|normal/i, key => qr/backup_watch/i );

The above will ignore events from all rules save those from the "backup_watch" rule.

=head3 Speeding it up: by timeframe

Auditd log rules also print a timestamp, which means we need a numeric comparison.
Pass in 'older' and 'newer', and we can filter out things appropriately.

Example:

    # Get all records that are from the last 24 hours
    my $rows = $parser->search( type => qr/path/i, nametype=qr/delete|create|normal/i, newer => ( time - 86400 ) );

=head3 Getting full paths with CWDs

PATH records don't actually store the full path to what is acted upon unless the process acting upon it used an absolute path.
Thankfully, SYSCALL records are are always followed by a CWD record.  As such we add the 'cwd' field to all subsequent records.
As such, you can build full paths like so:

    my $parser = Audit::Log->new(undef, 'name', 'cwd');
    my $rows = $parser->search( type => qr/path/i, nametype=qr/delete|create|normal/i );
    my @full_paths = map { "$_->{cwd}/$_->{name}" } @$rows;

=head3 Filtering by command

SYSCALL records store the command which executed the call.  This is exposed as part of the parse for each child record, such as PATH or DAEMON_* records.
Example of getting all the commands run which triggered audit events:

    my $parser = Audit::Log->new(undef, 'exe')
    my $rows = $parser->search();

    my ($self,%options) = @_;

    my ($cwd, $exe, $comm) = ('','','');
    open(my $fh, '<', $self->{path});
    LINE: while (<$fh>) {
        next if index( $_, 'SYSCALL') < 0 && !$in_block;

        next if $options{older} && $timestamp > $options{older};
        next if $options{newer} && $timestamp < $options{newer};

        # Snag CWDs
        if ( index( $_, 'type=CWD') == 0) {
